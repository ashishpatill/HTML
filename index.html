        <h1>Avocado Salad</h1>
        <p>Avocado Salad with a tangy lemon dressing, onion and tomato. This avocado salad is a simple, delish summer salad. The
        recipe is vegan and gluten free. Avocado salad is our favorite salad and I make it pretty often â€“ sometimes as a side
        and on occasions as a main meal with a nicely toasted sourdough loaf or bread.</p>

        <h2>About This Avocado Salad</h2>
        <p>Though there are many ways an avocado salad is made. I am sharing a recipe that is a vegan and gluten-free version. This
        is one avocado salad that I make many times.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Flavor profile:</strong> the subtle sweetness, smoothness and creaminess of the avocado give a sharp contrast to the crispness of
            the onions, the tanginess of the tomatoes and the lemon. The herbs and spices give a warming earthy flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon dressing:</strong> a small quantity of lemon vinaigrette dressing is made just enough for the salad. Adding this lemon juice, lemon zest,
            garlic & olive oil in the dressing makes the salad very flavorful. Some spices are also added in the dressing which
            gives slightly spiced and warm tones in the salad.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoked paprika:</strong> i must mention here that the addition of smoked paprika in the dressing brings some smokiness and heat
            in the salad. If you do not have smoked paprika, then you can easily substitute with cayenne or red chilli powder.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick & easy:</strong> it is a breeze to make this salad and gets done in 10 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Ripe avocado:</strong> For most avocado recipes, always use ripe avocado to get the best taste and texture. If the avocados are
            not ripe, then cover with a paper towel or brown paper and place them on the kitchen counter for some days till they ripen.</li>
